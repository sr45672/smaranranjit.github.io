		<h1>All About Tigers</h1>
		<p>
		Tigers (<i>Panthera Tigris</i>) are the largest members of the cat, or <i>Felidae</i>, family. 
		They are majestic and beautiful in nature, usually characterized by their orange fur with black stripes.
		The largest of tigers can measure up to 4 meters long and weigh up to 300 kg.
		Tigers can be found in varied parts of the world including the Siberian taiga, swamps, grasslands, and rainforests, mostly in the Asia.
		</p>
		<p>
		Unfortunately, the species of tiger are very endanagered throughout the world with only about 3200 left in the wild.
		This is mainly due to decades of poaching where Tigers were killed for their skin. Additionally, many of their habitats were
		destroyed giving them no where to live.

		<p>
		These factors caused three of the nine subspecies of tigers to go extinct, leaving the 
		other six not far from the same fate.
